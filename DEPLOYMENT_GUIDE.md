## 📋 Manual Steps Required

To complete the GitHub Pages deployment, you need to configure the repository settings on GitHub:

### Step 1: Change Default Branch to `main`

Since the old `gh-pages` branch is still set as the default branch, you need to change it:

1. Go to: https://github.com/TheCreateGM/Haqote-Page
2. Click on **Settings** (top menu)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Branches**
4. Under "Default branch", click the switch icon (⇄)
5. Select **main** from the dropdown
6. Click **Update** and confirm the change

### Step 2: Delete Old `gh-pages` Branch

After changing the default branch:

1. Still in **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Scroll down to see all branches
3. Find `gh-pages` branch
4. Click the trash icon (🗑️) to delete it
5. Confirm deletion

**OR** use Git command (after Step 1 is complete):
```bash
cd /home/axogm/Documents/note/WEBPAGE/Haqote-Page
git push origin --delete gh-pages
```

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to: https://github.com/TheCreateGM/Haqote-Page/settings/pages
2. Under **Source**, select:
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/ (root)**
3. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment

- GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy your site
- This typically takes 1-5 minutes
- You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready

### Step 5: Verify Live Site

Visit your live site at:
**https://thecreategm.github.io/Haqote-Page/**

Test the following:
- [ ] Page loads correctly
- [ ] All sections are visible (Hero, Features, How It Works, Preview, CTA, Feedback, Footer)
- [ ] Mobile menu works on small screens
- [ ] All links work (navigation, feedback form, footer links)
- [ ] Back to top button appears on scroll
- [ ] Smooth scrolling for anchor links
- [ ] Google Form link opens correctly
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile/tablet (test with browser dev tools)

## 🎯 Quick Command Reference

If you need to make updates later:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/axogm/Documents/note/WEBPAGE/Haqote-Page

# Make your edits, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main

# Wait 1-5 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading After 5 Minutes

1. Check GitHub Pages settings are correct (Step 3)
2. Look for build errors in repository Actions tab
3. Verify `index.html` exists in root directory
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### 404 Error on Sub-pages

- This is a single-page site, all navigation is anchor-based
- All links should be relative (no absolute paths)
- If you see 404s, check the browser console for errors

### CSS/JS Not Loading

1. Check file paths in `index.html` are relative (no leading `/`)
2. Verify files exist in correct directories:
   - CSS: `css/style.css` and `css/responsive.css`
   - JS: `js/main.js`
3. Check browser console for 404 errors

### Mobile Menu Not Working

- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in browser
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `js/main.js` loaded successfully

## 📊 Post-Deployment Checklist

After the site is live, verify:

- [ ] Site loads at https://thecreategm.github.io/Haqote-Page/
- [ ] All sections render correctly
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Feedback form link works
- [ ] No console errors in browser dev tools
- [ ] Images load (favicon, icons)
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions work
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (try Tab key)
- [ ] Back to top button appears after scrolling

## 🎨 Optional Enhancements

After successful deployment, consider:

### Add Real Screenshots

1. Take screenshots of HaqotePad application
2. Optimize images (compress to <500KB each)
3. Add to `images/screenshots/` directory
4. Update `index.html` to reference real images
5. Commit and push changes

### Add Favicon Formats

Create additional favicon formats for better compatibility:
```bash
# Add these to images/icons/
- favicon.png (32x32)
- apple-touch-icon.png (180x180)
- favicon.ico (16x16, 32x32, 48x48)
```

### Set Up Analytics

Add Google Analytics or similar:
1. Get tracking ID
2. Add tracking script to `index.html` before `</head>`
3. Monitor traffic and user behavior

### Add Open Graph Image

Create a preview image for social sharing:
1. Design 1200x630 image with HaqotePad branding
2. Save as `images/og-image.png`
3. Update Open Graph meta tags in `index.html`

### Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain:

2. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
3. Update GitHub Pages settings
